## Database Seeding

```bash
python manage.py seed_data
# Optional: set a custom admin password
python manage.py seed_data --admin-password mysecurepassword
```

Seeding is **idempotent** — safe to run multiple times without creating duplicates.

What gets seeded:
- 4 academic sessions (2021/2022 → 2024/2025, current = 2024/2025)
- 8 departments (CSC, EEE, BUS, MED, LAW, ACC, CVE, ECO)
- Full course list for Computer Science (100L–400L, both semesters)
- Course list for Business Administration (100L–200L)
- One superuser: `admin`
